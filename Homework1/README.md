##Welcome

this is my first homework assignment for BEW 1.1

there are is a lot of unnecessary code bits throughout the app.py. this is because I like to try stuff out during class. 

##Fortune teller

The fortune teller shows a basic html page that asks some random questions.

Depending on how you answer the question, the result will change. 

Here is a link to the assignment.

##Fortune teller 2

Leveing up this project means adding a templates folder, calling html files from app.py using flasks render template, and having at least 4 responses to the fortune teller page.
